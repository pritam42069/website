    <h1>Mod Application for the <a href="https://discord.gg/zFBfXDY7RY" target="blank">YADPS</a> discord server.</h1>
    <h2>What should a mod be able to do?</h2>
    <p>
        Since this is a computer science based server, the applicant must have some experience in IT. The more the better.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also expect you to know how to help people; Since you are going to be on often, helping people will be a common thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our server is small and hence not self-sustaining, meaning that the chat is often dead. We expect you talk in the general chat every now and then, and that you help make the community friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, we require you to have real moderation skills. You should be able to judge properly, avoid partiality of any kind, unless absolutely necessary, and should be able to understand what people want to say.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not supposed to mute/kick/ban people just because they break the rules, but rather also take the context of the situation in mind while making a decision. Mods might mute/kick/ban someone without a good reason, which alianate people, something we want to avoid.
    </p>
    <h2>
        If you think you fill the criteria listed above, feel free to apply.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Do note that moderating is a totally voluntary activity, and you will not recieve any pay. Also do understand that it also takes a moderate amount of commitment, and we understand if you are not willing to do so.
